# A Glance at New York Times Science and Technology News

## **Overview**

The generation of technologies is rapidly changing. The hotness in the new technology attracts people and capital, meanwhile, some area is losing attentions, like physics or biology. When Dolly was born, genetic engineering was a hot topic and young generations were willing to study it, however, there were not enough positions to absorb so many new graduates, quite a lot of them need to tune majors to find jobs after graduation. At this time, computer science or data science become popular, it is common to hear that the market needs millions of professionals in data science. But no exception, data scientist some day will have to face the similar situation like biologists now.

With this motivation, I want to read history, see the trend of a frontier technology or science subject in the past decades from New York Times. With more data, like statistics of labor in different position, maybe we can see when a new tech generates, how many unemployment it will bring to the market. Futher with more source or analysis, maybe we can predict the year that AI occupies some positions. 

## **Data Source**

All the data are from Leading documentation from [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/).

## **Goal**

Utilizing NLP,clustering to learn and analyze the language processing. In the four notebooks, 
- Scraped data and architected, hosted, and integrated MongoDB databases.
- Made topic modeling for technology news from 1945-2017 and Word Cloud each year.
- By unsuperived learning to cluster the news, got the interesting classes from the news.
- Extracted the named entity of Google, getting up to second layer of related companies to Google.
